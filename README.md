# Image Processing and Classification Projects

This repository contains two image processing projects: **HOG Feature Extraction and SVM Classifier** and **Image Segmentation for Background Transparency**.

## Projects Overview

### 1. HOG Feature Extraction and SVM Classifier (`HOG_FeatureExtraction_and_SVM.ipynb`)
This project focuses on creating an image classification pipeline to detect whether an image contains an elephant. The pipeline integrates advanced image processing techniques, including edge detection and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for accurate prediction.

#### Approach
1. **Canny Edge Detection with Edge Linking**:
    - **Noise Reduction**: A Gaussian filter is applied to reduce image noise.
    - **Edge Detection**: The Canny algorithm identifies edges by finding intensity gradients in the image.
    - **Edge Linking**: Edge linking via contour detection is employed to ensure continuous edge representation, improving feature quality.

2. **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**:
    - Used for feature extraction, HOG captures the shape and structure of objects by analyzing gradient orientations, which is robust to lighting variations.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier**:
    - SVM is selected for its strong performance in high-dimensional spaces like those generated by HOG features. It maximizes the margin between classes, ensuring high accuracy.

#### Dataset
- The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's Animal Image Dataset, containing images of 90 different animal species. The elephant images were used as the positive class, while all other animals were merged into a single negative class.

### 2. Image Segmentation for Background Transparency (`Image_Segmentation.ipynb`)
This project provides a Python script that processes an image to make its background transparent. The script uses OpenCV for image processing and Matplotlib for visual comparison of the original and processed images.

#### Key Features:
- **Image Reading**: Reads an image from a specified file path.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts the image to grayscale to simplify processing.
- **Binary Thresholding**: Applies a threshold to create a binary image, isolating the subject from the background.
- **Contour Detection**: Finds and selects the largest contour in the image to identify the main subject.
- **Mask Creation**: Generates a mask to outline the subject, making the background transparent.
- **RGBA Conversion**: Adds an alpha channel to the image, setting the background to transparent.
- **Saving and Plotting**: Saves the processed image with transparency and displays a side-by-side comparison using Matplotlib.
