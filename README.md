# Edge-Detection-and-Image-Classification
Image classification pipeline to detect elephants in images. It uses Canny edge detection with edge linking for robust edge extraction, followed by HOG for feature extraction. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on these features to accurately identify whether an image contains an elephant.
