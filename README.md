# Elephant Image Classification

This repository contains an image classification pipeline designed to detect whether an image contains an elephant. The pipeline integrates advanced image processing techniques, including edge detection and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for accurate prediction.

## Project Overview

This project is aimed at building a robust model for elephant detection in images. The approach combines edge detection, feature extraction, and machine learning to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing elephants from other animals.

## Approach

### 1. **Canny Edge Detection with Edge Linking**

Canny edge detection was chosen over other methods like Sobel for its ability to detect clear, well-defined edges with minimal noise. The process includes:

- **Noise Reduction**: A Gaussian filter is applied to reduce image noise.
- **Edge Detection**: The Canny algorithm identifies edges by finding intensity gradients in the image.
- **Edge Linking**: To ensure continuous edge representation, edge linking via contour detection is employed, improving the quality of the extracted features.

### 2. **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**

HOG was used for feature extraction because it effectively captures the shape and structure of objects in an image by analyzing gradient orientations. HOG features are particularly robust to variations in lighting and are widely used in object detection tasks.

### 3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier**

The SVM classifier was selected for its strong performance in high-dimensional spaces like those generated by HOG features. SVM's ability to maximize the margin between different classes ensures a high level of accuracy in classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Animal Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals). This dataset contains images of 90 different animal species. For this project:

- The **elephant** folder was extracted as the positive class (elephant).
- All other animal folders were merged into a single class as the negative class (non-elephant).

## Installation
